# Binit

Binit is an educational puzzle webgame about waste sorting ðŸ—‘.

The aim of this project is to provide an example of an interactive webpage created using HTML, Javascript, and PHP.

If you are learning the basics of web development, Binit can be a great example to study and practice your skills.

## Play
You can try the game [here](http://damngoodfreehost.infinityfreeapp.com/Binit/index.html).

## What I have used
I've used JQuery to implement drag and drop mechanics.

I'm currently hosting the game on Infinity Free, which provides PHP support and SQL to store the scores.

The aesthetics of the game are inspired by Material You by Google.

## Further development
- Modify the game to add new rules or challenges. Consider using different drag and drop libraries, such as React DnD or HTML5 Drag and Drop, to implement the game mechanics.
- Add user authentication and authorization to the game. Explore PHP sessions, cookies, or tokens to manage user login and logout, and restrict access to certain pages or features based on user role or permission level.
- Make the game more responsive and accessible. Utilize CSS media queries and flexbox to adapt the layout and style of the game to different screen sizes and devices.
